# Server Configuration
PORT=8000

# n8n Configuration (optional - for running n8n in Docker Compose)
# n8n will be available at http://localhost:5678
#
# Authentication Options:
# 
# Option 1: No Basic Auth (Recommended for local development)
#   - Set N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=false (or leave unset)
#   - First time you access n8n, it will ask you to create an n8n user account
#   - This n8n user account is stored in n8n's database (in ./n8n-data volume)
#   - Your workflows and n8n user account persist in the volume
#   - You'll login with the n8n account you created (not the .env credentials)
#
# Option 2: Basic Auth Enabled (Recommended for production)
#   - Set N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
#   - Set N8N_USER and N8N_PASSWORD below
#   - This adds an extra HTTP Basic Auth layer before accessing n8n
#   - You'll still need to create an n8n user account the first time
#   - You'll login twice: first with Basic Auth (from .env), then with n8n account
#
# IMPORTANT: Your workflows are ALWAYS stored in ./n8n-data volume
#            They persist regardless of authentication settings!
